We implement a simulation algorithm for the price of $$n$$ stocks in the well known Black-Scholes framework, first for $$n$$ independent stocks and then for $$n$$ dependent stocks. We assume the market coefficients $$\mu_i$$, $$\sigma_{ij}$$ are constant, so the price for stock $$i$$ is a stochastic process of the form $$S_i(t) = s_i \exp \left( \left( \mu_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \sigma_{i,j}^2 \right) t + \sum_{j=1}^{n} \sigma_{i,j} W_j(t) \right)$$. Due to this equation, the simulation of the $$n$$ stock prices reduces to simulating $$n$$ independent/correlated Brownian Motions.
